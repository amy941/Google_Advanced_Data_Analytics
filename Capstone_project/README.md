I'm working on it :)

# Forecasting Employee Turnover Rates & What Causes It

## Goal
- Providing HR with insights into why employees leave the company.

## Business Understanding
- HR department at Salifort Motors is looking for ways to boost employee satisfaction. They want data to help answer: _‚ÄúWhat factors lead employees to leave the company?‚Äù_
  
**- Tasks:**
  * Analyze data 
  * Build a model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave.

## Data Understanding
Google provided datasets for a fictional company called "Salifort Motors". The data includes about 12,000 employees, each with 9 features related to satisfaction level, performance evaluation, salary, company history, department, and contributed projects.

### 1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals:
### 1.1) Descriptive Statistics

 [Add figure]  


 
‚úçüèª _I examined the dataset using statistical methods and gained critical insights:_
* **Satisfaction level** scores a **moderate average (0.61)**, but **25% of employees** report **low satisfaction** (<= 0.44)
* **Last Evaluation** achieves a **high mean of 0.72**, suggesting **strong overall performance**
* **Number of Projects** averages **around 4**, while some employees handle up to **7 projects max**
* **Average Monthly Hours** range widely from **96 to 310**, while typical full-time hours fall 160-180 hours/month, suggesting **overwork** for some employees
* **Time Spent at Company** averages **3.5 years**, some employees staying **up to 10 years**
* **Work Accidents** occurred in about **14.5% of cases**, which is **relatively frequent**
* **Attrition Rate** is **high at 23.8%**, meaning **1 in 4 employees left**
* **Promotions in the Last 5 Years** are **very rare (2.1%)**, pointing to **limited career growth**.
  
    
### 1.2) Data Exploration (continue EDA)

[ add figure]


  * **~83% of employees staying**
  * **~17% of employees left**
    
### 1.3) Data visualization

 [ADD PLOT]

 
_Ratio plot also shows the same findings:_

  **83% staying, 17% left**

### 2) Relationship between ```average_monthly_hours``` and ```promotion_last_5years```


 [ADD PLOT]


 
 ‚úçüèª **Categorical scatter plot** shows:
  * Blue dominated on Top row--> **Most promoted employees stayed, very few promoted left**
  * On the far right, most dots appear on the bottom row--> **High-hour workers were rarely promoted**
  * Orange toward right end--> **Leavers worked the longest hours, eventually left**

 ### 3) Correlation Heatmap

_Correlation Heatmap shows how strong variables are related to each other, gives a number from:_
* **1** (strongly go up together)
* **0** (no relation)
* **-1** (one goes up, other goes down)
  
 [add Heatmap]


 #### Key Insights üóùÔ∏è
- **Satisfaction and Leaving:** The darker box with **-0.39** means people who are **less satisfied are more likely to leave** the company.

- **Projects and Hours:** The box with **0.42** means if someone has **more projects**, they also usually work **more hours**.

- **Evaluation and Projects:** With a score of **0.35**, people with **better performance** evaluations often **get more projects**.

- **Leaving and Work Accidents:** A weak score of **-0.15** means people who **had an accident are less likely to leave**, but it's not very strong.

- **Promotions and Leaving**: A tiny number **-0.06** means promotions and leaving the job **aren‚Äôt really connected**.

- **Most other boxes are light-colored**, which means **many things aren‚Äôt strongly related**.

### Conclusions ‚úçüèª
- People who work on **more projects** usually **work longer hours** and get **better performance scores**.
- People who are assigned **more projects** tend to be **unhappy** at work and more **likely to quit**.

### 4) Logistic Regression

_Correlation score between -1 and 1:_
* **1** = very strong connection (go up together)
* **0** = no connection
* **-1** = opposite connection (one up, one down)

[add heatmap]


### Key Insights üóùÔ∏è

- **Number of Projects & Monthly Hours: 0.33**
‚Üí People who do **more projects** also work **more hours**.

- **Evaluation & Number of Projects: 0.27**
‚Üí People with **better evaluations** tend to have **more projects**.

- **Evaluation & Monthly Hours: 0.26**
‚Üí **Better performers** also tend to work **more hours**.

- **Satisfaction & Tenure (Years at Company): -0.15**
‚Üí People who **stay longer** may be slightly **less satisfied**

- **Satisfaction & Projects: -0.13**
‚Üí **More projects** might mean a little **less happiness**.

- **Satisfaction & Monthly Hours: -0.0063**
‚Üí Almost **no link** between happiness and working long hours.

- **Evaluation & Tenure: 0.097**
‚Üí A **tiny connection** between experience and performance.

### Conclusions ‚úçüèª
- People with **more projects** usually **work more hours** and **perform better**.
- There‚Äôs **no strong link** between how **happy** people are and how much they **work**.
- **Staying longer** at the company might make some people a bit **less satisfied**.

### 5) Confusion Matrix

[ add figure]

### Key Insights üóùÔ∏è
- **Top left (True Negatives):** 2165 -- People who **stayed**, computer guessed they would **stay**. Yay, correct guess! ‚úÖ
- **Top right (False Positives):** 156 -- People who **stayed**, but computer wrongly guessed they would **leave**. Oops! ‚ùå
- **Bottom left (False Negatives):** 348 -- People who **left**, but computer guessed they would **stay**. Oops! ‚ùå
- **Bottom right (True Positives):** 123 -- People who **left**, and computer guessed they would **leave**. Yay! ‚úÖ

### Conclusions ‚úçüèª
- If the computer was perfect, it would only make correct guesses.
  * People who **stayed**, would be in **Top left**
  * People who **left**, would be in **Bottom right**

### 6) Recal evaluation metrics

[add figure]

### Key Insights üóùÔ∏è
The Logistic Regression model achieved:
- Precision of 79%,
- Recall of 82%,
- F1-score of 80%,
- Accuracy of 82%,
- AUC score of 89%.

### Conclusions ‚úçüèª
- Logistic Regression model looks **pretty good overall** with 82% Accuracy
- However, the **model isn't as good** when predicting employees who **leave**, scores significantly lower

## Results & Evaluation
1) Employees with more projects, will overwork, and get better performance scores.
2) Employees with more projects, are unhappy, and more likely to leave.
3) No strong connection between working hours and employee satisfaction.
4) Longer tenure is slightly associated with lower satisfaction over time.
5) Logistic Regression model works well for stayers, but not leavers.
